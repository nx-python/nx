class Player:
    """Represents a player.
    You shouldn't instantiate this yourself.
    Rather, access Player objects via
    ``nx.p1``, ``nx.p2``, ... ``nx.p8``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    number: int
        The player's number, e.g. Player 1's number is 1.
    controller: :class:`Controller`
        The player's controller.

    In addition, a Player has several properties depending on
    the type of :class:`Controller` they are using.
    To begin with, a Player will have a property that points to
    a :class:`Button` for each of the Buttons their Controller has.
    These properties can return ``None`` if a Button is not available
    on the Controller used by the Player.
    Furthermore, a Player will always have the properties ``left``,
    ``right``, ``up``, ``down`` and ``stick``. These work similar
    to the ones found in the Controller classes.
    Finally, a Player can also have the properties ``left_stick``,
    ``right_stick``, ``left_joycon`` and ``right_joycon`` if their
    controller has these attributes.
